# Rest: Ressource

**Abstraction of information**

A resource has a representation
- data
- metadata
- hypermedia links

## 1 Ressource identifiers

REST uses resource identifiers to identify each resource involved in the interactions between the client and the server components.

## 2 Hypermedia

Media type identifies a specification

Every addressable unit of information carries an address (implicit or explicit)


> Hypertext (or hypermedia) means the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions.
> 
> Remember that hypertext does not need to be HTML (or XML or JSON) on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.
> — Roy Fielding

## 3 Self descriptive

**Resource representations shall be self-descriptive**

So in practice, we will create lots of custom media types – usually one media type associated with one resource.

> Nothing can be quite so obscuring as a bad comment

> Comments are not pure good

## 4 Comments are a last resort / The proper use of comments

> Every comment is a failure

- Compensate for our failure to express ourselves with code
- Try everything else, then comment as last resort



## 5 Comments Lie

> Comment degrades over time

> We paint our comment in a way to ignore them

## 6 Comments do not make up for bad code / Explain Yourself in code

> Do not write comment, clean code

## 7 Legal and  Informative Comments / About Design Patterns book



## 8 Explanation of Intent / Clarification



## 9 Warning of Consequences / TODO Comments

> Don't commit TODO

## 10 Amplification / Javadocs in Public APIs

> Javadocs is good for public API

> Be explicit, don't talk about implicit consequences. 

- Redondance

## 13 Journal Comments / Source code control system


## 14 Noise Comments / Scary Noise / Use explanatory code, not comments


## 15 Position Markers / Closing Brace Comments / Attributions and Bylines


## 16 Commented - Out Code / HTML in comments ICK!


## 17 Non - Local Information

> Only talk about code that's right there

## 18 How many lines should there be in a source file?

- moyenne: 50
- max: 100

## 19 Analysis of the lengths of lines

- ideal: 40 char long
- max 150, to avoid scroll 

## 20 Names are Everywhere / Reveal your intent / Rules to write Names

> Function: Exact inverse of the name of a function, the larger the scope, the smaller the function name 

> Classes: Same a function

## 21 Disambiguate / Avoid Convenient Mispellings


## 22 Number Series / Noise Words / Distinguish Names Meaninfully

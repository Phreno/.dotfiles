# Uncle Bob: Clean Code, lesson one

- [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&t=2438s)

## 2 Introduction to Clean Code

## 3 What is a Clean Code?

> The only way to go fast is to go well

- elegant
- efficient
- one things well
- simple
- direct
- readable
- written by someone who cares

## 4 Analyzing some lines of code

> Every line of a function should be at the same level of abstraction. That level should be one below the name.

- Intermediate working state 

## 5 Long code is not Good Code

> Smaller is better

## 6 Good Code / Refactored Function

> Explanatory variable

## 7 Polite Code / Rules for writing a news paper article

> Allow the reader to escape early

## 8 Shrunk Code / The Rules of Functions

> Function should do one thing

- 1 Small
- 2 Smaller

One thing is when you can't extract something from it

## 9 Shrunk Code / Drawing a Function

> Big function have class hidden inside

> Find the true object-oriented structure of the system

- Extract method by globalizing variables

## 10 When and why was Java invented?

- James Gosling
- 1963

## 11 Prose Code / Arguments

> The indent level should be max 2

```java
if(isTrue()){ // one function 
  doSomething() // one function
}
```
> No more than 3 arguments, else why not an object

> Don't pass boolean into function, make 2 function

> No double take

> Principle of least surprise

## 12 Avoid Switch Statements / Problems and Evolution of some programming languages

> Switch act as dependency magnet

- Tends to break Open/close Principle

> Jar exists to independently deploy chunk of your system

## 13 Output Arguments No Side Effects / Garbage Collection

> A side effect is a change of a state of a system

> Side effect function comes in pair (ex: create-delete/alloc-free like Sith)

- no side effect

## 14 No Side Effects / Using Lambda

How to deals with side effects

```java
void open(String fileName, Î» proc){
  File f = File.open(fileName);
  proc(f);
  f.close();
}
```

## 15 No Side Effects / Command and Query Separation

> `void` should have a side effect

> Other functions should not have a side effects


## 16 No Side Effects / Prefer Exceptions to returning error codes

> No nested try/catch

Only a `try` in a function that throws Exceptions

## 17 DRI Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)


## 18 Structured Programming / Edsger Dijkstra Vision vs Actual Vision of the programming

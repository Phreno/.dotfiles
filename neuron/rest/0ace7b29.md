## Summary

REST
: architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).

Resources 
: Have to be decoupled from their representation.

Representation
: Clients and servers exchange representations of resources

- standardized interface and protocol. 
- Typically HTTP is the most used protocol, but REST does not mandate it.

Metadata
: available and used

- to control caching, 
- detect transmission errors, 
- negotiate the appropriate representation format, 
- and perform authentication or access control.

> And most importantly, every interaction with the server must be stateless.

All these principles help RESTful applications to be simple, lightweight, and fast.
